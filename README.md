#### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
#### 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Steps

#### 1. Download the data source namned UCI HAR Dataset.
#### 2. Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset.
#### 3. Run run_analysis.R to generate a new data file.
